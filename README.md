# TwentyNineteen Child Theme

This child theme uses best-practice methods for enqueueing parent styles, and includes CSS and JS files that will automatically avoid file-caching when updated.

## Cool Features

* Pre-included files for your CSS (main.css) and JS (script.js)
* Smart automatic cache-buster for main.css and script.js. If you update them, they'll get a new version tag when enqueued. If you haven't updated, it won't change. This helps keep things efficient.
* Literally nothing else. This is truly very barebones.
* The love of the Saftey Llama for using one of our tools! safetyllama.com.
